Education
======
* Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2021 - Present

* M.S. in Statistics, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2024

* B.S. in Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 2021
  * Minor in Computer Science


Experience
======
* Summer 2021, Research at Karsten Reuter Group, Fritz Haber Institute
  * Compared Bayesian and ensemble methods of uncertainty quantification for machine-learned interatomic potentials to improve active learning framework.
  * Explored uncertainty recalibration methods to improve the quality of uncertainty measures.

* Summer 2019 – Spring 2021, Research at Zachary Ulissi Group, Carnegie Mellon University
  * Calculated adsorption energies of different adsorbates and surfaces with density functional theory (DFT) to find desirable catalysts for electrochemical processes.
  * Organized and analyzed past DFT data to assess efficiency of current high-throughput automated workflow.
  * Trained machine learning models to prioritize high-success calculations and skip futile calculations.
  * Took part in the development of a flexible machine learning potential to learn from atomic simulations.
  * Developed an active learning framework that learns the correction between first principle theory and simple physics-based potentials to serve as an inexpensive DFT surrogate.

* Summer 2018, Internship at BorsodChem, Hungary
  * Oversaw the pipe replacement process in the toluene diisocyanate and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate production plants.
  * Translated between Chinese and Hungarian to facilitate communication between colleagues to ensure daily procedures were efficiently conducted.
  * Supervised the Chinese welders and pipefitters in the Hungarian work environment to comply with local work habits and safety standards.
