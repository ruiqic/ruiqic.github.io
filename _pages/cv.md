Education
======
* B.S. in Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 2021
  * Minor in Computer Science


Experience
======
* Summer 2019–Current, Research at Ulissi Group, CMU
  * Calculated adsorption energies of different adsorbates and surfaces with density functional theory (DFT) to finddesirable catalysts for electrochemical processes.
  * Organized and analyzed past DFT data to assess eﬀiciency of current high-throughput automated workflow.
  * Trained machine learning models to prioritize high-success calculations and skip futile calculations.
  * Took part in the development of a flexible machine learning potential to learn from atomic simulations.
  * Developed an active learning framework that learns the correction between first principle theory and simplephysics-based potentials to serve as an inexpensive DFT surrogate.

* Summer 2018: Internship at BorsodChem, Hungary
  * Oversaw the pipe replacement process in the toluene diisocyanate and methylenediphenyl diisocyanateproduction plants.
  * Translated between Chinese and Hungarian to facilitate communication between colleagues to ensure dailyprocedures were eﬀiciently conducted.
  * Supervised the Chinese welders and pipefitters in the Hungarian work environment to comply with local work habits and safety standards.
