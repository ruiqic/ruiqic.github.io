I am currently a first-year PhD student in the [School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering](https://chbe.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).

I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. In the summer of 2019, I joined the research group advised by [Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/). My research focused on applying machine learning to speed up high throughput catalyst screening. 

Prior to university, I graduated from [American International School of Budapest](https://www.aisb.hu/) in Hungary. In my free time, I enjoy video games, reading, and board games.
