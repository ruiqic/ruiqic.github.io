I am a senior undergraduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. In the summer of my sophomore year, I joined the research group advised by [Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/). My research focuses on applying machine learning to speed up high throughput catalyst screening. 

Prior to university, I graduated from [American International School of Budapest](https://www.aisb.hu/) in Hungary. I spend my free time playing video games and board games with friends.
