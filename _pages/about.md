I am currently a first-year PhD student in Machine Learning in the [ H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/) to automate and control complex cell therapy manufacturing processes.

I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. In the summer of 2019, I joined the research group advised by [Prof. Zachary Ulissi](https://zulissi.github.io/). My research focused on applying machine learning to speed up high throughput catalyst screening. 

Prior to university, I graduated from [American International School of Budapest](https://www.aisb.hu/) in Hungary. In my free time, I enjoy making music, reading, and video gaming.
